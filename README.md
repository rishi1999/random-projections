# Random Projections
This repository is a collection of our group's work during the Summer@ICERM 2020 REU program.

A link to an Overleaf document with a thorough explanation of the mathematical background and results can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ffnmgtrbbkhz).

## Experiments (non-exhaustive)
The `notebooks` folder contains all of our coding experiments.

### Eigenfaces
We use a database of real pictures of faces to extract the components of an average that can be added up to reconstruct approximations to any specific face.

### Image Compression
We use randomization to find low-rank approximations to image, making it easier to use these images for data analysis and computation.

### JL Lemma
We numerically verify some of the claims made in the [Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma).

### Least Squares
We compute approximate 'least-square' solutions to linear systems that do not have an exact solution, and then compare the accuracy to that of the best of a randomly sampled set of vectors.

## Presentations
The `presentations` folder contains all our files for the biweekly group presentations at ICERM. These mostly consist of Jupyter notebooks with extensive descriptions and explanations of the code / phenomena.
